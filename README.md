Dear Visitor 👋,

I am writing to express my interest in the position advertised in your recent job circular. With over 7 years of professional experience as a JavaScript-based developer—and more than five years specializing in React Native—I bring a proven track record of building robust, scalable, and user-centered applications across both mobile and web platforms.

I have also worked on a SaaS-based CRM product built with a micro-frontend architecture, which strengthened my ability to design modular, maintainable, and large-scale systems.

My technical expertise includes React, Vite, Next.js, React Native, TypeScript, Redux, RTK Query, Zustand, Firebase, and various real-time communication technologies. I have hands-on experience integrating advanced features such as mapping solutions, Twilio voice calls, push notifications, SMS/MMS services, email automation, and live data synchronization using sockets. These capabilities have enabled me to deliver end-to-end solutions that are performant, reliable, and aligned with modern industry standards.

On the backend, I have experience with Node.js and Nest.js, working with both MySQL and PostgreSQL databases to build secure and scalable APIs.

I am particularly passionate about creating clean, efficient architectures and writing high-quality, scalable code. I enjoy collaborating with cross-functional teams, solving complex technical challenges, and contributing to overall product strategy and user experience.

I am confident that my background, strong ownership mindset, and dedication to delivering exceptional results make me a valuable addition to your team. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experience align with your project and organizational goals.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to your team.

Sincerely,
Mohammad Erfanul Islam Sifat
