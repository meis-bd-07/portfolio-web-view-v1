    <title>Erfanul Islam | Mohammad Erfanul Islam Sifat | Erfan Sifat | JS Fullstack Developer</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Erfanul Islam | I am a JavaScript-focused developer with 7+ years of experience building scalable, high-performance web and mobile applications. As a full-stack mobile app developer specializing in React Native, I create robust hybrid apps for both Android and iOS. My expertise includes React, React Native, Node.js, NestJS, Next.js, and TypeScript—allowing me to design complete end-to-end solutions. I have worked with micro-frontend architecture, multilingual platforms, permission-based systems, SaaS products, and social engagement features such as reviews, follow systems, collections, sharing, and stories. I also have strong skills in API development, database design (MySQL & PostgreSQL), Firebase notifications, and developer tooling including CodeRabbit, ESLint, Husky, and path aliases. With 4+ years of team leadership, I excel in Agile environments using GitHub, CI/CD, Docker, and cloud technologies." />
